# Data Ingestion Script

The symbols which have to be analysed can be added to the list "Symbols" in line 16.

Before running the ingestion script, PostgreSQL has to be setup on the host machine. In case of Windows, SQLite also
needs to be setup.

Create the database "crypto_data" (or any other name) in PostgreSQL before running the script. Also configure the username
ans password accordingly.
